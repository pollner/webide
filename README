This is a mashup of jQuery-plugins and PHP to build up webbased IDE.
It's just a proof of concept, but I it really works. 
And it's a quick way to code with not too huge files.
But if your files too huge, you make something wrong, isn't it?

The main part of all is EditArea, you can find here:

The apache-user needs rights to write.
For easy usage you can change the owner of your webroot for example:
# chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www

For PHP Shell 2.4:
user: alice
password secret
